Horizon module
===========================

The horizon module consists of two classes.

The Horizon class inherits from the :ref:`Magstim class <linkmagstim>` , just as the Rapid class and Bitstim class do.
The QuickFireBox class inherits from a class defined in `this repository <https://github.com/neuromti/app-arduino>`_ for controlling arduino microcontrollers in order two stimulate with low latency via BNC.
