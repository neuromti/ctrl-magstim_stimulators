A Python toolbox for controlling Magstim TMS stimulators via serial communication.

The original toolbox is https://github.com/nicolasmcnair/magpy, however, in this version the horizon stimulator is included.

There is an option to stimulate with low latency ("quickfire") via an arduino, based on the app-arduino repo: https://github.com/neuromti/app-arduino.
